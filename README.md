**Efficient Portfolio and Hedge Ratio Analysis**

This repository contains Excel-based analyses and reports on constructing an efficient portfolio and cross-hedging strategies. 
The projects cover portfolio optimization using stocks from Fortis and Jindal Steel, and cross-hedging between Silver and Crude Oil. 
Both projects focus on financial modeling to measure portfolio performance and manage risk effectively.

**Project 1: Efficient Portfolio of Fortis and Jindal Steel**
- Objective: Create an efficient portfolio using stocks from Fortis and Jindal Steel, analyzing daily returns from April 2018 to March 2021.
- Methodology: Daily returns were analyzed to calculate mean return and standard deviation. Portfolio risk (1.90%) and return (0.086%) were derived based on these metrics.
- Efficient Frontier: Multiple weight combinations were tested to plot the efficient frontier, with the minimum variance point highlighted.
- Visualization: Generated an efficient frontier to demonstrate optimal portfolio configurations. Interactive buttons allow for adjusting correlation values to observe portfolio changes.

**Project 2: Cross-Hedging Silver and Crude Oil**
- Objective: Determine an optimal hedge ratio for cross-hedging Silver using Crude Oil futures, considering data from January 2018 to December 2021.
- Methodology: Calculated the hedge ratio using changes in spot and futures prices, yielding a ratio of 0.136. Conducted linear regression to verify, finding the beta coefficient matching the hedge ratio.
- Tools: Used Excel and Google Sheets with XLMiner for regression analysis.
- Key Outcome: Successful verification of the hedge ratio, providing an effective cross-hedging strategy.
